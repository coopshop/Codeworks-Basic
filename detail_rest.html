					<h1>REST Best Practices</h1>
					<time>3:30 - 4:20</time>
					<h2>D. Keith Casey</h2>

				<p>Stateless.. Nouns & Verbs.. Idempotent.. HTTP Auth.. Tokens.. We've 
					all heard those phrases thrown around when we talk about REST. We've 
					been told our systems have to include these characteristics or 
					they're not RESTful. We've talked over and over again on how to 
					implement them. Unfortunately, somewhere along the way, we lost the 
					answer to "why?" What's the point? What value do we gain by doing 
					things the "right" way?</p>
